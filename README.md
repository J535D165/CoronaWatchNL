# Dataset: COVID-19 case counts in The Netherlands

**CoronaWatchNL** collects numbers on COVID-19 disease count cases in **The Netherlands**. The numbers are collected from various sources on a daily base, like [RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment)](https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus), [LCPS (Landelijk Coördinatiecentrum Patiënten Spreiding)](https://www.lcps.nu/), [NICE (Nationale Intesive Care Evaluatie)](https://www.stichting-nice.nl/), and the [National Corona Dashboard](https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/). This project standardizes, and publishes data and makes it **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)**. We aim to collect a complete time series and prepare a dataset for reproducible analysis and academic use.

Dutch:
> CoronalWatchNL verzamelt ziektecijfers over COVID-19 in Nederland. Dagelijks worden de cijfers verzameld van het [RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor de Volksgezondheid en Milieu)](https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus), [LCPS (Landelijk Coördinatiecentrum Patiënten Spreiding)](https://www.lcps.nu/), [NICE (Nationale Intesive Care Evaluatie)](https://www.stichting-nice.nl/) en [Nationale Corona Dashboard](https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/). Dit project standaardiseert en publiceert de gegevens en maakt ze vindbaar, toegankelijk, interoperabel en herbruikbaar (FAIR). We streven ernaar om een dataset beschikbaar te stellen voor reproduceerbare analyses en wetenschappelijk gebruik.


## Datasets
The datasets available on CoronaWatchNL are updated on a daily base. Availability depends on the publication by the respective sources (N.B. since July 1st, the epidemiological reports published by RIVM will be released on a *weekly* instead of daily basis). The CoronaWatchNL project divides the datasets into four main categories:

* [Geographical data](#geographical-datasets)
* [Descriptive data](#descriptive-datasets)
* [Intensive care data](#intensive-care-datasets)
* [Miscellaneous datasets](#miscellaneous-datasets)

For (interactive) applications based on these datasets, have a look at the [applications folder](/applications). For predictive models based on these datasets, check out the parallel repository [CoronaWatchNL Extended](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNLExtended). Please note that the intention of these (too) simplistic models - made by CoronaWatchNL volunteers - is to show how the data can be used for modelling,  *not* to answer specific hypotheses or follow scientific protocol.

Please see the [Remarks](REMARKS.md) document for notes about the datasets. Do you have remarks? Please let us know


### Geographical datasets

#### Reference time: 10:00 AM

These datasets describe the new and cumulative number of confirmed, hospitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases. Every day, the data is retrieved from the central database [OSIRIS](https://www.rivm.nl/sniv/handleiding-osiris) at 10:00 AM by RIVM. The datasets are categorized by their geographical level (national, provincial, municipal).

For more detail about the specific structure of the geographical datasets, have a look at the `data-geo`[codebook](/data-geo/README.md). <br/>

| Dataset | Source | Variables |
|---|---| --- |
| [Reported case counts by date in NL](data-geo#national) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases), (Cumulative) Count|
| [Reported case counts by date in NL per province](data-geo#provincial) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Province, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases), (Cumulative) Count |
| [Reported case counts by date in NL per municipality](data-geo#municipal) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Municipality, Province, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases), (Cumulative) Count |

#### Reference time: by day (0:00 AM)

These datasets describe the new and cumulative number of confirmed, hospitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases per day. The data is retrieved from the central database [OSIRIS](https://www.rivm.nl/sniv/handleiding-osiris) and counts the number per day (0:00 AM) by RIVM. The dataset concerns numbers on a national level.

For more detail about the specific structure of the geographical datasets, have a look at the `data-geo`[codebook](/data-geo/README.md). <br/>

| Dataset | Source | Variables |
|---|---| --- |
| [ Case counts by date in NL ](data/rivm_NL_covid19_national_by_date/) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased patients), (Cumulative) Count |

#### Visualizations geographical data

To get a better picture of the content of the geographical datasets, have a look at the following visuals. These visuals show the development of the COVID-19 disease outbreak on a national level.

[![plots/map_province.png](plots/map_province.png)](/data-geo/README.md)


### Descriptive datasets

The datasets in this section describe the new and cumulative number of confirmed, hospitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases per day and contain variables like age and sex.

For more detail about the specific structure of the descriptive datasets, have a look at the `data-desc`[codebook](/data-desc/README.md). <br/>

| Dataset | Source | Variables |
|---|---| --- |
| [Case counts in NL per age](data-desc#age) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Age group, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases), (Cumulative) Count |
| [Case counts in NL per sex](data-desc#sex) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Sex, Type (Total, hopitalized and deceased COVID-19 cases), (Cumulative) Count|
| [Deceased case counts in NL per sex and age group](data-desc#deceased) | [RIVM](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Age group, Sex, (Cumulative) Count of deceased cases |


#### Visualizations descriptive data

The graphs below visualize the development of the COVID-19 disease outbreak per sex and age group.

### Intensive care datasets

The intensive care datasets describe the new and cumulative number of COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions per day. The datasets are categorized by their source. Compared to RIVM (reporting COVID-19 hospital admissions), CoronaWatchNL collects COVID-19 related intensive care data from LCPS and NICE. 

* **RIVM** reports hospitalized COVID-19 cases, including - but not limited to - the intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. These are the largest numbers and most inclusive counts.
* **NICE** only reports COVID-19 cases that are admitted to the ICU.
* **LCPS**, similarly to NICE, reports COVID-19 ICU admissions. However, LCPS tries to compensate for the reporting lag, by estimating its size and adding it to the numbers reported by NICE.


For more detail about the specific structure of the intensive care datasets, have a look at the `data-ic`[codebook](/data-ic/README.md). <br/>

| Dataset | Source | Variables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [COVID-19 intensive care patient counts in NL ](data-ic#nice) | [Stichting NICE](#data-collection-sources) | Date, New, Total and Cumulative ICU admissions per day, Number of ICUs with at least one COVID-19 case, New and Cumulative fatal, survived and discharged ICU admissions |
| [COVID-19 intensive care patient counts with country of hospitalisation ](data-ic#lcps) | [LCPS](#data-collection-sources) | Date, Country of Hospitalization, Total COVID-19 ICU admissions |


#### Visualizations intensive care
The first two graphs show the number of new (*Nieuw*), total (*Actueel*), cumulative (*Cumulatief*), deceased (*Overleden*), and survived (*Overleefd*) COVID-19 ICU admissions per day, as declared by NICE. The total number of ICU admissions per day as reported by LCPS is also shown.
