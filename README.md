# Coronavirus disease in The Netherlands based on RIVM reports

![corona_artwork.jpg](corona_artwork.jpg)

The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. On 27 February 2019, a patient in The Netherlands was diagnosed with the coronavirus (COVID-19), according to the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). Within a week, more than a hundred cases were confirmed. The RIVM reports the number of positive cases on its [website](https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus). 

Since 3 March, RIVM reports the number of diagnoses with the coronavirus and their municipality of residence on a daily base. The data contains the total number of positively tested patients. It is not a dataset with the current number of sick people in the Netherlands. The RIVM does not currently provide data on people who have been cured. The [raw numbers]( https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/onderwerp/infectieziekten/regionaal-internationaal/coronavirus-covid-19#definities) can be found on the government-owned website https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info.  

## This project

:exclamation: Daily updates :exclamation:

At the moment of writing, RIVM and https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info don't publish datasets with the date of diagnosis on their websites. Therefore, it is hard to get an overview of development in time (and municipality). This information is important to journalists and scientists as well as for the public. Therefore, this project downloads the latest numbers from the website of the RIVM **every hour** and pushes the data to this repo. Please see the folder  [raw_data/](raw_data/) for the non-processed data downloaded from RIVM. The folder [data/](data/) contains processed datasets ready to use for analysis. 

Datasets:

  - :page_facing_up: [RIVM Coronavirus counts in The Netherlands since February 27](data/rivm_corona_in_nl_daily.csv) :exclamation: Daily updates :exclamation:
  - :page_facing_up: [RIVM Coronavirus counts in The Netherlands for each municipality since February 27](data/rivm_corona_in_nl.csv) :exclamation: Daily updates :exclamation:
