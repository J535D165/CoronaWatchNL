# Coronavirus disease in The Netherlands based on RIVM reports


The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. On 27 February 2020, a patient in The Netherlands was diagnosed with the coronavirus (COVID-19), according to the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). Within a week, more than a hundred cases were confirmed. The RIVM reports the number of positive cases on its [website](https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus).

Since 3 March, RIVM reports the number of diagnoses with the coronavirus and their municipality of residence on a daily base. The data contains the total number of positively tested patients. It is not a dataset with the current number of sick people in the Netherlands. The RIVM does not currently provide data on people who have been cured. ~The [raw numbers]( https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/onderwerp/infectieziekten/regionaal-internationaal/coronavirus-covid-19#definities) can be found on the government-owned website https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info.~ The most recent numbers can be found at https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-kaart-van-nederland. 



## This project :exclamation: Daily updates :exclamation:

At the moment of writing, RIVM and https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info don't publish datasets with the date of diagnosis on their websites. Therefore, it is hard to get an overview of development in time (and municipality). This information is important to journalists and scientists as well as for the public. Therefore, this project downloads the latest numbers from the website of the RIVM **every hour** and pushes the data to this repo. Please see the folder  [raw_data/](raw_data/) for the non-processed data downloaded from RIVM. The folder [data/](data/) contains processed datasets ready to use for analysis.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Graphs

The following graphs show the development of Coronavirus on a daily basis. The underlying data can be found in [data/rivm_corona_in_nl.csv](data/rivm_corona_in_nl.csv). The [graphs](/graphs) are updated on an hourly basis and were generated automatically. Please validate the numbers in the graphs before publishing. See the license section for information about sharing the graphs.

### Forecast

The first predictions are based on exponential growth model.
![plots/prediction.png](plots/prediction.png)

Note, however that the data no longer behave exponentially. If we plot them on
a log axis they deviate from the line quite drastically!
![plots/prediction_log10.png](plots/prediction_log10.png)

Thus we try to fit a sigmoidal curve. One way to fit this, is to first estimate
the growth rate, which we define here as the ratio of new cases over previous
new cases. Once this growth rate reaches 1, it is likely that the data will
stop following an exponential pattern and will taper down into a sigmoid
curvature.

Here is the development of the growth factor over time, with a linear model fit
to try to estimate when the inflection point will occur (or has occurred).

This then results in the following sigmoidal fit:
![plots/sigmoid.png](plots/sigmoid.png)

As some provinces had the outbreak earlier than others, it's relevant to see the individual provinces. The same linear model is used to estimate the inflection point.

![plots/sigmoid_Zeeland.png](/plots/sigmoid_Zeeland.png)
![plots/sigmoid_Zuid-Holland.png](/plots/sigmoid_Zuid-Holland.png)

As testing capacity is limited the numbers of positively tested people doesn't give a realistic picture of the outbreak. Using the data of people being hospitalised should give a more realistic picture.

Here is the development of the growth factor over time, with a linear model fit
to try to estimate when the inflection point will occur (or has occurred).

This then results in the following sigmoidal fit:
